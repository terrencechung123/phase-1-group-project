Rick and Morty Character Cards

Hello and welcome to our Rick and Morty Character Cards project for the phase 1 cohort of FlatIron School! Here you will find our Rick and Morty Character Cards page, which lists 5 different character cards, all including 3 different attributes that describe each character. AS you progress on the page, you will notice that you can interact with the elements on the page through addEventListeners! We also left a hidden addEventListener, do you think you will be able to find it?

User Experience:
    The user should be able to:
-Fetched an API with the base of “https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/”, and create a project that includes html, css, and js.
-A user should see 5 different objects on page load; which displays a character, a character title, a character image, and atleast 3 attributes that describe the data.
-On the character cards will include a drop down button that the user can click to display character card attributes.
-Users will be able to click on the “heart like button” and increment the like number by 1 for each click.
-Users will be able to experience an asynchronous javascript process that will provide the user faster refresh times.

BONUS DELIVERABLES:
1.Create like button at the bottom right corner of each character card.
2.Have number of likes display next to heart and have it increment by 1 for each click.
3.let each picture have its own unique likeCount
Current branch progression:
    -Created a character list form that will provide the user the ability to create their own character.
    -Provided a icon on the title tab.
    -Added images pinned on Header, added button flashes on like button and see more button.
    -Added the ability to hover your mouse over the image to display the image description in text.
